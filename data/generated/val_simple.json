  "We need the primary exchange gateway to deliver order entry latency of no more than 1 ms and jitter under 0.1 ms, while keeping the link up at least 99.999% of the time, because any extra delay or variability directly erodes our price‑time advantage in the market.",
  "Our SCADA system must stay online almost all the time – we need at least 99.99% availability – and any control command has to reach the field devices within 20 ms, otherwise the grid could become unstable during rapid load changes.",
  "We need this slice to be treated as high priority for both control‑plane and user‑plane decisions because it carries a mission‑critical service for our enterprise client.",
  "We need the slice to support up to 50,000 devices per square kilometre.",

  "Please allocate a guaranteed uplink throughput of 5,000 kbps for the new IoT network slice.",
  "For the science building’s remote lab simulations we must guarantee a maximum downlink throughput of 250 Mbps per network slice and keep availability at 99%, otherwise high‑resolution data sets will time out and experiments will be delayed.",
  "Predictive‑maintenance data from the CNC machines can handle up to 15 ms latency, but we require the data feed to be at least 99.95% available so the analytics engine sees a continuous trend and can schedule service before a failure.",
  "We require a static allocation where the slice is bound to a predetermined list of devices and no further user changes are permitted after provisioning.",
  "The GBR QoS flow for the IoT slice must guarantee at least 1.5 Mbps downlink, so set the GFBR‑DL accordingly.",
  "We need the network to allow user‑plane changes without any perceived loss of service for the UE, even if the PDU session anchor moves and the IP address changes.",
  "The customer requires all user traffic to be routed through a secure VPN tunnel back to their private data center, so the data network access should reflect termination in a private network.",
  "Please set the V2X‑PC5 network slice to operate in scheduled mode – use the value 1 for this attribute.",
  "According to our SLA, all NSP‑provided communication services must have their performance KPIs sampled as often as technically feasible, essentially continuous monitoring.",
  "Please enable the data network access for Local Breakout while the subscriber is roaming.",
  "When we transfer high‑resolution patient imaging between facilities we need encryption at least AES‑256 (256‑bit key) and SHA‑256 integrity, while keeping latency under 30 ms to avoid delaying diagnosis.",
  "We need the whole campus Wi‑Fi to be available at least 99.5% of the time so that live lecture streams never drop, because any interruption could affect accreditation reviews.",
  "The mobile ordering system for concessions must handle roughly 30,000 terminals; each slice should provide at least 100 Mbps of downlink, but we would like the ability to scale up to 200 Mbps during peak intermission periods when order volumes spike.",
  "Please enable MMTel on the new slice; we need it turned on (value 1).",
  "Provide a URLLC‑grade slice for our Industry 4.0 robotic assembly line, supporting 1 ms latency and 99.9999% availability.",
  "For drone‑based hull inspections we require sub‑centimetre positioning – ideally 2 cm – and ultra‑low latency under 5 ms so the live video feed stays synchronized with the navigation system; the link must also achieve 99.999 % reliability to prevent any data gaps during the inspection pass.",
  "The network should limit the downlink packet loss for voice GBR traffic to no more than one lost packet per hundred packets.",
  "Set up a massive IoT slice with the least stringent QoS requirements, using the appropriate 5QI.",
  "For the corporate slice, ensure the guaranteed downlink capacity can support 50 concurrent video‑conference streams, each needing 150 kbps.",
  "Since the low‑power IoT slice already stays under the power‑per‑throughput limit, we want to turn off its energy‑efficiency KPI monitoring.",
  "Our drone delivery service demands that the positioning solution stay within a few centimeters error margin to ensure safe package drop zones."
