  "We anticipate 3 million IoT sensors spread across a 10 km² industrial park, requiring the slice to sustain the sensor density.",
  "Our esports tournament needs a seamless experience for 10,000 concurrent players worldwide.",
  "For the eMBB service using 5QI 78, the PER must be kept below one‑thousandth of the transmitted packets.",
  "Our video‑surveillance slice should sustain a minimum uplink floor that can carry ten HD camera streams, each requiring 300 kbps, without degradation.",
  "Our V2X service requires full control‑plane provisioning for both NR and LTE PC5 interfaces; configure the V2X‑PC5 provisioning attribute accordingly.",
  "For the telemetry stream, handle each packet independently and do not group them; the network should ignore any relationship between successive PDUs.",
  "The VIP lounges will accommodate about 5,000 premium guests who will be using 4K video streaming and high‑resolution photo sharing; each slice serving the lounges must guarantee at least 200 Mbps of downlink throughput.",
  "For the 5QI=85 slice, the uplink capacity must not exceed 4 Mbps.",
  "Please turn on NB‑IoT support for the new IoT slice; we need the NB‑IoT flag set to enabled.",
  "Our AR collaboration tool should feel smoother than our current 60 fps video chat, targeting 'fluid' performance.",
  "The capacity‑planning team wants the maximum PDU‑session metric to reflect only regular sessions, not any LBO‑initiated ones.",
  "Please enable the highest level of monitoring and analytics (value 2) on the new 5G slice."
