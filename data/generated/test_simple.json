  "Since the private network will handle termination of data sessions, apply the default tunnelling configuration.",
  "Please turn on non‑IP traffic support on the new edge routers; we need it enabled (value 1).",
  "The slice should be able to transport full Ethernet frames without any fragmentation, which means the MTU must be at least the standard 1500‑byte payload.",
  "Configure the PC5 scheduled mode to use the third option defined for NR PC5 defaults.",
  "Enable EPS counting for the maximum number of PDU sessions; set the flag to 1.",
  "Our network must be resilient enough to handle a network of weather stations spread across 200 km², each sending roughly 10 MB of data per hour, with a target density of at least 10 stations per 20 km² to ensure fine‑grained micro‑climate monitoring.",
  "Our conveyor‑belt synchronization must keep the command latency under 5 ms and stay online at least 99.99% of the time, otherwise the product feed will drift and cause mis‑alignment on the assembly line.",
  "The slice must guarantee a minimum downlink rate of 2 Mbps for the aggregate GBR flows.",
  "Please allocate a guaranteed downlink flow bit rate of 3000 kbps for the GBR slice supporting voice over LTE.",
  "The low‑latency slice serving autonomous‑vehicle telemetry should be limited to a moderate uplink bandwidth level—neither the lowest nor the top tier—so pick the appropriate service class.",
  "Configure the private data network termination to use tunnelling mechanism 1.",
  "We need this slice to carry mission‑critical push‑to‑talk traffic, so enable the appropriate MC support flag.",
  "Our V2X rollout needs the primary NR PC5 mode that handles scheduled broadcasts without LTE fallback.",
  "Need a 'rock‑solid' network for real‑time financial trading.",
  "Our video streaming service must run smoothly on mobile devices.",
  "The uplink capacity per user equipment should be capped at 2 Mbps.",
  "Our network will run a mixed‑traffic slice for premium customers that should operate alongside best‑effort traffic without any performance degradation. Ensure the slice’s simultaneous use setting reflects full coexistence.",
  "We require that the slice have at least one KQI for availability monitoring; otherwise the slice should be considered unsupported.",
  "We need uninterrupted wireless coverage along the entire 3 km of main haulage tunnels, with a minimum availability of 99.95%, so that remote‑controlled drilling rigs can stay online without costly downtime.",
  "Please configure the uplink maximum throughput for all IoT devices in Slice A to use Service Category 2.",
  "We want a 'green' network for our data center interconnect.",
  "Please configure the performance monitoring sample frequency to 1 for our voice services.",
  "Please configure the new network slice so that it is only accessible in Greece (country code GR).",
  "We require a guaranteed downlink throughput of 2 Mbps for the video streaming slice, so set the MFBR‑DL accordingly.",
  "The esports training lab needs ultra‑low jitter—below 1 ms—and latency around 10 ms to keep replay synchronization exact; packet loss must be essentially zero (0 %) and we require five‑nine availability (99.999 %) to avoid any interruption during practice sessions.",
  "The device must be placed in the same simultaneous‑use class as our high‑priority video streaming group, which is mapped to Service Category 3 in the policy table.",
  "The subscriber should be treated as a premium user, so assign the corresponding service category from the supported data networks list.",
  "We need an ultra‑reliable connection for our mission‑critical drone fleet that can tolerate any single link failure without dropping packets.",
  "Our legacy public‑safety devices only support the 2 GHz band, so the slice should be confined to that spectrum.",
  "Our loyalty app pushes personalized offers in real time; any lag drops conversion, so we require a downlink capacity of 100 Mbps per slice, latency no greater than 30 ms, and 99.95% availability to keep the experience seamless.",
  "We want the video‑analytics batch jobs to run only after the network reaches off‑peak (after 8 pm), so the service can tolerate delays.",
  "Protective relays require ultra‑fast and ultra‑reliable links: we need end‑to‑end latency under 5 ms and an availability of 99.9999% so that trips are executed without missing a fault.",
  "Our SLA demands that the guaranteed flow bit rate is always exclusively allocated, never shared with other traffic – select the Resource Type that guarantees permanent resources.",
  "Please configure the UE to use Service Category 2 for simultaneous slice usage.",
  "The system must automatically switch traffic to a secondary route and maintain load balancing during any fault to keep mission‑critical applications running, implying both redundancy and load‑balancing capabilities.",
  "Please enable deterministic communication for the new slice; set Availability = 1.",
  "The slice must provide guaranteed latency for PLC traffic, so deterministic communication must be supported.",
  "We need to support up to 100,000 UEs that have at least one active PDU session or PDN connection on this slice.",
  "We demand an ultra‑reliable connection for our autonomous drone fleet that can tolerate zero packet loss.",
  "The SLA for this slice requires no latency degradation under any congestion scenario, as it supports emergency response communications.",
  "The temperature sensors in our refrigerated containers only need to report every few minutes, so a latency tolerance of up to 100 ms is fine, but we still expect the network to deliver at least 99 % of the packets to ensure we catch any temperature excursions promptly.",
  "The slice must be GSMA PRD NG.114 compliant for multimedia telephony, meaning MMTel must be present.",
  "For the upcoming stadium event, we anticipate a crowd of 70,000 spectators, each with a device, but only about 70% will be active on the network at any given moment; therefore, the slice must support the maximum simultaneous UEs required.",
  "Assign 5QI 2 to the new video streaming slice.",
  "Our new AR/VR service requires the minimum possible latency; please configure the scheduling parameters so that the packet delay budget is effectively disabled.",
  "The slice must sustain a high‑definition video uplink stream (1080p@30 fps), which translates to roughly a 3 Mbps guaranteed flow rate.",
  "Enable delay‑tolerant mode for the firmware‑upgrade traffic; set delay tolerance to 1.",
  "Please ensure that the Network Slice Customer supplies the UPF and UDM functions for our new eMBB slice."
